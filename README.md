# TypeScript

### TypeScript is a Statically typed language, and is a superset of JavaScript

Typescript is a superset of Jabascript, meaning it's a layer around JS that add methods that you could't use without.

### Statically typed?

A language could be Dynamically or Statically typed:

~~~~

// Statically typed: you declare the type of a variable
// C#

int a;

// Dynamically typed: the type is detected by the langauge
// Javascript

var a = 'Hi';

~~~~
